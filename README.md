The aim of the project is to zip the files parallely by building a parallelized version of non concurrent zip.
# Sequential-Zip
First we build a sequential zip using two encoding schemes, Huffmann and Run Length. All the code files related to sequential zip are included in the Week1 folder. 
This was followed by optimizing the coding schemes to get performnace in terms of compression time and compressed file size.
